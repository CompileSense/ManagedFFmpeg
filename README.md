#ManagedFFmpeg
==========

C++/CLI wrapper for ffmpeg3.1.1

Initial checkin is a broadly working subset. My current focus is on using FFMPEG for encoding
audio & video with one of a few specific encoders, and the implemented wrappers reflect that
fact.

Hopefully this project is the groundwork for a more complete implementation which will develop
as time and enthusiasm permits.
